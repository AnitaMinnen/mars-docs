**Mars** - **M**olecule **AR**chive **S**uite is a collection of ImageJ2 commands for single-molecule analysis based on a cored data model of molecule objects for optimal storage and multithreaded processing of large single-molecule time-series datasets.

This site is currently undergoing major changes and has many broken links. Check back within the next weeks for the final version.

To get started with Mars, take a look at the [tutorials](tutorials), [example gallery](examples), and [usage guide](usage), or read [about the project's goals](about).

### Commands
Once you have installed MARS in your Fiji using the update site, the submenu "MoleculeArchive Suite" will show up under the Plugins menu. Usually in the bottom section. In this submenu are a series of commands for general processing of single-molecule data. There are tools for both the analysis of fluorescence data as well as particle findering, fitting, and tracking. From there a range of other commands allow for fitting, filtering, sorting, and manual classification.
